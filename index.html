                      I have had my pleasure of serving as Sanket&#39;s MS project advisor for Fall 2018, during which he analyzed large-scale smartphone GPS and extracted their social travel behavior. Above all, I was impressed with Sanket&#39;s ability to understand and solve the problem efficiently, his choice of visualization library to show his work was very good. He is also good at explaining his reports and finding clearly. I was also impressed with the way he designed the probabilistic model and tableau dashboard. Sanket would be a true asset for any positions requiring R, Python, and Tableau and comes with my heartfelt recommendation.
